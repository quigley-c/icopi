# icopi
Icopy or **I**mage **Co**lor **Pi**cker is a tool I came up with
while attempting to configure my new galliumOS install with bspwm. I was
thinking of how I should configure my colors in particular and I thought,
"why not use my background image to inform my color choice?" The only caveat
is that I never use the same background image for long. So I need a tool to pick
my colors for me!
